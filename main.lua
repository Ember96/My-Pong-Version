    This implementation is based on the "GD50 2018 Pong Remake"
    as part of the "CS50's Intro to Game Development" Harvard 
    free course.

    Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two
    paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting
    the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.

    This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
    the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
    resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on 
    modern systems.

    Some of the code has been re-written to improve organization
    and readability. Some features have been added to improve and
    accelerate the gameplay experience. New sounds effects has been
    added to enhance the inmersibility.

    New features:   Paddles are larger now but decrease in size
                    everytime they hit the ball.
